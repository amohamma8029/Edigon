# EDIGON

Edigon is a short singleplayer turn-based RPG created in Python using mainly the pygame library.

# PROJECT SETUP

To run the game itself, you may simply execute the `Edigon.py` file found in the root of the repository. However, in order to run the game as intended, please ensure the following. 

## REQUIREMENTS 

### INSTALLATION

The requires the pygame to run properly. If you don't have pygame installed onto your device, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install it.

Then, simply run this command into the command prompt:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### OTHER

Once you have pygame, make sure that all the assets & external scripts for the game are in the same location as the `Edigon.py` file *(most likely in the root of the folder)*.
